# Crontab Component (React)

This component will help you build Crontab values in a much easier fashion. If you are advanced users and knows the cron value, feel free to put it into the input box and it'll adjust the Select dropdown for you. If you don't know the cron value, just use the easy dropdown to select when and how often do you want your cron value, and this will automatically update the string in the input.
